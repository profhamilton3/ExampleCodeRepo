# ExampleCodeRepo
Test repository to sample GitHub Features

## Intro -Second Level Header
We will use github features relavent to the course of study.
### Body 01:  Why GitHub -Third level header
### Body 02: Collaboration
Express steps for sharing and collabortion. 
Branches and committing.  This comment is mad in *-patch-1 branch.  A future comment will be made the merged file back on the main branch. You will have the ability to roll back changes. Creating branches gives opportunity for collaborative development. 

*-patch-1 has been merged.  The option  is available to delete the branch completely.  I have used the testing framework to define methodes in the test.py file.  Added test_runner.py -these test_*.py and *_test.py files run automatically when pytest is called from commandline.  pytest installs in ~/Library/Python/3.9/bin - on my macos system.
### Body 03: Coding inside GitHub
### Body 04: Testing inside Github
Automated Workflow built into GitHub.  This branch has a workflow script.  We will test it fully before merging back to main. Running test happens automatically when files are named as mentioned above.  We have altered our script to name test files explicitly to include the file  named test.py -which does not follow the naming convention.  Because of this we must add the all subsequent files by name to the pytest args list.
